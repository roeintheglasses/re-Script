## üéØ Best Practices

### File Organization
- Use descriptive file names
- Keep files under size limits
- Batch related files in single jobs

### Provider Selection
- **Claude**: Best for complex, heavily obfuscated code
- **GPT-4**: Good balance of speed and quality
- **Ollama**: For privacy-sensitive or offline processing

### Job Management
- Regularly clean up old jobs
- Monitor processing costs (for API providers)
- Use appropriate timeouts for large files

### Performance Optimization
- Process files during off-peak hours
- Use smaller concurrency for better quality
- Enable caching for repeated processing

## üîê Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Files are temporarily stored during processing
- Automatic cleanup after job completion
- No persistent storage of sensitive code

### API Keys
- Store keys in environment variables only
- Never commit keys to version control
- Use provider-specific key restrictions when available

### Access Control
- Consider implementing authentication for production
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Configure CORS origins appropriately

## üìà Future Features

### Planned Enhancements
- **Batch Processing**: Upload and process multiple jobs simultaneously
- **API Integration**: Full REST API for programmatic access
